# Nexter
Nexter is a simple landing page design for a fictional property company. I have build this project using **CSS Grid**.

### Overview
---
The total layout of the page and alingement of the properties are all made with grid only. I have used a 8-column grid to build the layout. This project uses almost all the properties CSS Grid offers. And i have made the webpage responsive fitted for smaller scrrens too.

#### Like the basic grid properties-
+ grid-gap
+ grid-template-column
+ grid-template-rows
+ grid-row
+ grid-column
#### basic alignment properties-
+ Align-items
+ justify-items
+ align-content
+ justify-content
+ align-self
+ justify-self
#### Sizing and Units-
+ fractional unit(fr)
+ minmax()
+ min-content
+ max-content

I get to know a lot about **CSS Grid** with this project and got to apply the concepts in practice.<br>
